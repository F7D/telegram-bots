unreal4u's telegram Bots
=======

Quick and dirty collection of bots I own on Telegram. Mainly a playground until further notice.

Available bots: 

* **unreal4uBot**: Will be used to play around and test some options
* **TheTimeBot**: Will be able to tell you the current time of any given timezone
* **uptimeMonitorBot**: Will parse an incoming webhook coming from UptimeRobot.com and send it to a Telegram chat_id

Please checkout the [wiki page](https://github.com/unreal4u/tg-timebot/wiki) I've made to know how the bots actually
work.
